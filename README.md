# hledger-web

A Haskell app that uses [Miso](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/miso) and [hledger's Haskell libraries](https://hledger.org/) plus [ghcjs](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) to be compiled to a web page, and then adds [optional remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io/) so you can store your ledger data somewhere else.

This is actually just a static webpage hosted for free on a big provider and is unlikely to get closed anytime soon.

You can use it while at the same time storing your data on Dropbox or Google Drive through the remoteStorage widget, or even your own remoteStorage server.
